\section{What is Free Software?}
\textbf{Free software means the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.}
	Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer". 
\begin{itemize}
\item The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
\item The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
\item The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
\item The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). 
\end{itemize}
