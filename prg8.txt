\section{Introduction to Theorems \&\ Corollaries}
Mathematical documents include elements that require special formatting and numbering such as theorems, definitions, propositions, remarks, corollaries, lemmas and so on. This article explains how to define these environments in LaTeX.
Numbered environments in LaTeX can be defined by means of the command $newtheorem$ which takes two arguments:
Theorems can easily be defined:

\begin{theorem}
Let \(f\) be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then \(f\) is 
a continuous function.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
\label{pythagorean}
This is a theorem about right triangles and can be summarised in the next 
equation 
\[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
\end{theorem}

And a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next 
corollary.

\begin{corollary}
There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm.
\end{corollary}

You can reference theorems such as \ref{pythagorean} when a label is assigned.

\section{Introduction to Definition}
A feature that is important when working in a mathematical document is to easily tell apart, say, definitions from theorems by its formatting. The package amsthm provide special commands to accomplish this.

Unnumbered theorem-like environments are also possible.

\begin{remark}
This statement is true, I guess.
\end{remark}

And the next is a somewhat informal definition
\begin{definition}[Fibration]
A fibration is a mapping between two topological spaces that has the homotopy lifting property for every space \(X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Absolute value function] 
The absolute value function can be specified as a two-part definition as follows: \\
$
|x| =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		x  & \mbox{if } x \geq 0 \\
		-x & \mbox{if } x < 0
	\end{array}
\right.
$
\end{definition}

\section{Introduction to Lemma \&\ Proof}
defines a new theorem-like environment called "lemma". The first argument \{lemma\} specifies the name of the environment to be used in the document, and the second argument \{Lemma\} is the heading text that will be displayed whenever a lemma is referenced.
\begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively there is a 
real number \(r\) such that \(b=ra\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
To prove it by contradiction try and assume that the statement is false,
proceed from there and at some point you will arrive to a contradiction.
\end{proof}
